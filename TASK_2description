This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, is used for this classification task. This project demonstrates the process of loading data, preprocessing, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.

Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with four features:

Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)
Each sample belongs to one of three species:

Setosa (0)
Versicolor (1)
Virginica (2)
The dataset is included in the scikit-learn library, making it easy to load and use.
Results
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set. The model was also able to correctly classify a new sample with measurements [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2] as Setosa.

Future Improvements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore different values for the number of neighbors in the KNN algorithm to optimize performance.
Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Feature Engineering: Investigate the impact of additional feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
